    <h2>Upload Chrono Files</h2>
    <p>Any files you add will be added to the already existing files on the server.</p>
    <p>Supported files: KLM Chronos (checked for ICA), KLC monthly overviews, Joozdlog CSV, some exports for MCcPilotLog and LogTen pro. Try it, mail me files that fail!</p>
    <p>The data in the uploaded chrono's is not complete, so some assumptions will be made:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All flights are with 2 crew</li>
        <li>All simulators are done in the type that the next flight after it was done in</li>
        <li>No other (private) flights are flown in the period</li>
        <li>All flights are IFR</li>
        <li>Not all simulator duties might appear. If that is the case, please mail a roster with it to joozd@joozd.nl</li>

    </ul>
    <p>If you run into any issues or have feedback, please contact me at joozd@joozd.nl</p>
    <p><b>This is still work in progress. Please provide your own cover page.</b></p>
